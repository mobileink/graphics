Conditions of adequacy for a graphics language:

    Expressivity

    Coordinate space independence

    Device Independence

Drawing a figure always involves two specifications, one explicit, the
other (usually) implicit.  The explicit specification describes the
figure: size, shape, style, location.  The implicit specification
describes the coordinate space.  The explicit specification (of a
figure) is always relative to a coordinate space.

CS (Coordinate Space) specification:  origin (always 0) + axes

Axis specification:  name, unit (always 1?); angle of incidence; orientation; scale (??? see below)

[NB: figure specification relative to space; cspace specification always absolute.]

E.g. Cartesian space has x and y axes, each with unit of 1, angle of
incidence of 0 and 90 deg, respectively, and orientation of x
increases rightwards, y upwards.

Example: unit circle centered at the origin.  The usual way to specify
this is something like

     (0,0 circle(1)  (using tikz syntax; any other would do as well)

This is the explicit specification; implicit is the specification of the CS.

But there are always two coordinate spaces: the one in which
coordinates are directly expressed (as above), which we'll call the
Omega space, and the "root" space to which the Omega space is mapped.
In other words, specifying a figure and a space is not enough; the
space itself must be located in a "parent" space, which in the
simplest case is the "root" space.

[Root space is axiomatic: x and y axes with unit = 1, incidence 0 and
90, the usual orientation.  Root space is also absolute; it cannot be
mapped to any other space (except device space?).]

[NB this is all device independent.  Mapping root space to device
space is a separate issue.]

[NB third kind of space, between device independent (abstract) root
space and device space: device-independent space with empirical units
of measure.  E.g. x and y axes with unit = 1cm (instead of just 1).]

An example will expose the distinction.  Most graphics languages have
a "transform" function that allows the user to translate, scale,
rotate, or skew figures.  The syntax usually makes it look like the
figures are being transformed; e.g.

    let c = (0,0) circle (1)  ;; figure: unit circle at origin
    translate(c, (1,1))	      ;; move origin of circle to (1,1)

But that is the wrong interpretation; what gets transformed is the
entire coordinate space in terms of which the figure is directly
expressed.  We need a vocabulary that allows us to express this
explicitly.  In the example, we want a way to say explicitly that the
transform operator applies to a CS, not to a figure.  For example (toy syntax):

1)	  let origin(cs:Omega) = origin(cs:Root) + (1,1)  ;; start by specifying translation of cs:Omega
2)	  let c = (0,0) circle (1) in cs:Omega  ;; then specify figure relative to cs:Omega
3)	  result: unit circle located at (1,1) in cs:Root

A more succinct (possible) notation, using [ ] to indicate a cs "context" :

1)	  let cs:Omega[(0,0)] = cs:Root[(0,0)] + (1,1)  ;; origin in Omega coords = (1,1) in Abs coords
2)	  cs:Omega[(0,0) circle 1]   ;; circle expressed in cs:Omega coordinates
3)	  result: unit circle located at (1,1) in cs:Root

This may get the idea across, but the problem is that the transform
expression only specifies the translation of a single point; it does
not explicitly say that the entire cs is transformed.  A
transformation is a function, but 2) does not clearly express this.

CS transformations are functions and should be expressed as such.

We could associate transformations with the axes of a CS.  For
example, for cs:Cartesian we might write:

	 axis : {name="x", unit=1, transform=lambda x.x, incidence=0}
	 axis : {name="y", unit=1, transform=lambda y.y, incidence=0}

But where do the inputs to the transform functions come from, and what
is the meaning of their outputs?  The basic idea of a transform is
that it maps points in one CS to points in another CS.  But the
definition of an axis is scoped its CS, which leaves open the question
of where we find the xs and ys to which the transforms apply.

The solution to this problem is to see that transformations are not
associated with particular spaces.  They map one space to another,
both of which are in themselves independent of the transformation.  So
we do not want to include a transformation function as part of the
definition of a CS.  It's tempting to do so (possibly because of the
influence of Object-Oriented thinking), but incorrect; a
transformation is just a function, and is not connected with any
"class" or "object".  This will lead us below to consider an algebra
of coordinate spaces.

It follows that we have to define a default "scale" for each axis,
just as we define a default unit of 1.  Axiomatically, as it were.

In other words, it is not accurate to say that transforms "change"
coordinate spaces.  Instead, they map all the coordinates from one
space to another, leaving both spaces per se unchanged.  This is
critical, since it allows us to express various figures, each in its
own cs, and then map them to a single "parent" cs under different
transforms.  If transforms had the effect of producing a "distorted"
version of the source space, this would not be possible, or at least
it would be much more awkward.

So how should we express such transformations?  First, since they are
functions, we can use lambda notation to express them.  E.g.

3)	   lambda x.x
4)	   lambda x.2x   ;; scale x axis by factor of 2
5)	   lambda x.ln x ;; logarithmic x axis

Second, we should make explicit the fact that inputs are coordinates
in one space, and outputs are coordinates in another:

6)     x_a = lambda x_b.x_b  ;; where _a = cs:Root, _b = cs:Omega

In other words, we need a typed lambda calculus.

Third, they are applied to cspaces, but not part of their definitions.
So:

7)	x:B["x"] = lambda a::A["x"].2a

where foo::Bar["baz"] means foo is a coordinate on the "baz" axis of space Bar.

(This notation is awkward, but at this point we are interested in
clarity and explicitness.)

Whatever sort of notation we come up with, we still have the problem
of how to express the idea that one space is to be mapped into another
("into" literally, points into space) /under/ a transformation
function.  In other words, in addition to specifying the function
(possibly as a lambda expression), we also need to express the domain
and range.

Maybe something like the following, which apes y=f(x) notation:

	   cs:B.x = f(cs:A.x)

But y=f(x) defines a function; it does not explicitly state dom and ran.

To be really explicit we might try:

      f = lambda x.2x
      dom(f) = cs:Omega
      ran(f) = cs:Root

This has the virtue of clarity.  But each figure in a composition has
its own "home" cspace, which we call Omega, so we may end up with lots
of Omegas.  This would leave us to define f for each pair of spaces,
even if they use the same function.  E.g.

     f = lambda x.2x
     dom(f) = cs:Omega.x, ran(f) = cs:Root.x
     ... draw some stuff into cs:Omega
     dom(f) = cs:Gamma.x, ran(f) = cs:Root.x
     ... draw some stuff into cs:Gamma

Here we use two spaces to draw stuff, but map them both to the same
space using the same transformation.

Advantage of lambda notation: much easier to express complex
transformations.  Although vector/matrix notation is pretty handy.

With lambda we don't need predefined functions like "translate",
"scale", etc.  (Same is true of vector/matrix notation.)

With lambda we also get non-linear transformations, e.g. 

     f = lambda x.x^2

So a key design decision: how to express transformation functions.
lambda or matrix?

Another key design decision: how to express the dom and ran of
transformation functions.

[We seem to be approaching something like the standard notion of
layers.  But with the notion of cspace, we don't need layers.  Or
rather, layering is a separate idea, which corresponds to order of
composition.  We can think of cs:Omega as the top of a stack of
cspaces, i.e. last (first) in a series of transforms, but we can use
the same cspace in multiple stacks.]

Transform functions v. positioning functions

Both kinds are total functions; the difference is in how they are
used.  Transform functions are to be applied to entire coordinate
systems, mapping every point.  Positioning functions are just like
transforms, but are intended to be used on subsets of the space,
esp. on single points in path expressions.

Some of TikZ's coordinate systems effectively function as positioning functions.

================

An Algebra of Coordinate Spaces

In addition to origin and axes, coordinate systems always have an
algebra, which specifies operations on coordinate points.  This allows
us to distinguish between e.g. cartesian and complex cspaces.

Cartesian:

   +  =  scale unit of source arithmetically; e.g. cs:A[(0,0)]+(1,1)
   *  =  scale unit of source geometrically: (x,y)*(a,b) = (ax,by) e.g. cs:A[(1,1)]*(2,2) 
   ?  =  rotation
   ?  =  skew (shear)
   ?  =  reflection
   ?  =  glide reflection (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transformation_(function))

NB: "scale" usually means scale multiplicatively, but it applies
equally to arithmetic transformation.  We can talk of arithmetic,
geometric, harmonic, etc. scaling.

Complex:

    * = (x+yi)*(a+bi) = (xa - yb) + (xb + ya)i
      	(x,y)*(a,b)   = ((xa-yb), (xb+ya))
	e.g. (1,0)(0,1) = ((0-0), (1+0)) = (0,1) = i
================

Primitive Coordinate Spaces

Affine:  "In mathematics, an affine coordinate system is a coordinate system on an affine space where each coordinate is an affine map to the number line. In other words, it is an injective affine map from an affine space A to the coordinate space Kn, where K is the field of scalars, for example, the real numbers R.  The most important case of affine coordinates in Euclidean spaces is real-valued Cartesian coordinate system. Orthogonal affine coordinate systems are rectangular, and others are referred to as oblique." (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affine_coordinates)

Homogenous:  "In mathematics, homogeneous coordinates or projective coordinates, introduced by August Ferdinand Möbius in his 1827 work Der barycentrische Calcül,[1][2] are a system of coordinates used in projective geometry, as Cartesian coordinates are used in Euclidean geometry. They have the advantage that the coordinates of points, including points at infinity, can be represented using finite coordinates. Formulas involving homogeneous coordinates are often simpler and more symmetric than their Cartesian counterpart." (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homogeneous_coordinates)

Cartesian  (logarithmic a special case?)
Polar
Complex
Cylindrical
Spherical
Log-polar

TikZ:

Canvas =  x,y with explicit "dimension" (empirical UOM)

XYZ    =  x,y,z as "factors" multiplying unit vectors of length 1cm)

Canvas Polar = radius expressed in canvas system, i.e. with UOM

XYZ Polar  = radius and angle interpreted in as in xy csystem, i.e. factors (of unit vectors of 1cm) not dimensions

XY Polar (=XYZ Polar)

Barycentric  -  "In geometry, the barycentric coordinate system is a coordinate system in which the location of a point of a simplex (a triangle, tetrahedron, etc.) is specified as the center of mass, or barycenter, of masses placed at its vertices. Coordinates also extend outside the simplex, where one or more coordinates become negative."   (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barycentric_coordinate_system)

Node (=DOM?)  The cs:node is parasitic the more primitive empirical
systems.  It allows you to refer to a previously specified point by
specifying its name and an "anchor" or predefined location relative to
the node's position.  The anchor name effectively denotes a function
that computes a point, given the node' base point.

Tangent Like cs:node, cs:tangent supports specification of points by
refering to previously specified points.  A tangent function is
implicitly applied to the points refered to - actually a point and a
figure - and computes the tangent from the point to the figure.

Custom -- the job of a custom cs is to compute x and y in the canvas
coordinate system.  So defining a custom coordinate system boils down
to specifying a transformation function.

TikZ has no abstract Cartesian coordinate system (contrast Asymptote);
systems that allow unitless coordinate specifications (e.g. XYZ) use
an implicit empirical UOM (default: 1cm).

Thus all TikZ cspaces are empirical; some seem to provide means of
expressing coordinates rather than establishing a distinct system;
e.g. node and tangent systems.  They don't (at least not all of them)
establish a primitive interpretation of (x,y).  For example, the
tangent cs does not provide a meaning for any (x,y); instead, it
allows you to specify a (tangent) point by reference to an already
specified pair of a shape and a point.

In other words, cs:node and cs:tangent are derived systems, the others
primitive.  They are essentially transform functions using for
positioning.  They do not need units of measure since that is already
implicit in the points they reference.  Dunno about barycentric, which
I don't really grok yet.

Basically all the cspaces amount to positioning functions, which is
why they can be mixed in single path expressions.

Correction: they are NOT transform functions, in that they do not
transform the entire csystem; instead they are positioning functions,
designed to transform subsets of the space.

Furthermore, TikZ's system allows for use of multiple coord systems in
one expression.  So you can write (0,0) -- (polar cs:
cs:angle=90,radius=1cm), using first the xyz system then the polar
system to draw a line from the origin to (0,1), unit=cm.

Note that the xyz cs seems to be the default for (x,y) syntax, where x
and y are dimensionless.

================


Primitive cspaces always same, alterations come via transforms.
Untransformed, the default is just plain Cartesian space, unit=1,
scale is identity func, incidence 0 and 90, orientation standard.

But what about polar space?  We can transform a cartesian space into a
polar space, but we cannot draw directly into a polar space using
cartesian coordinates.  So we need polar space as a primitive space.
Two axes: angular (length along circumference) and radial (length of
vector).

================

For browsers (rather, XML structures), treat the DOM as coordinate
space?

================

Scales

Note that some transform functions, e.g. scaling, can be applied to
anything, not just axes.  For example, color gradients, color maps
(see pgfplots).  So cspaces and axes and ink (styles) are all
distinct, but transform functions can apply across the board.

================

D3 first "selects" DOM nodes, then brings in the data.  That seems
backwards.  First read the data, then project to the design space.

================

The DOM+CSS model.  Boxes (some of them, anyway) implicitly define
coordinate systems.  Adding an element - a paragraph, say - to the DOM
does two things: it inserts a node into the (abstract) tree, and it
maps the new node to a figure located in a coordinate space.  So to
the hierarchy of the DOM corresponds a hierarchy of cspaces.
Ultimately constrained by the display device.

What about adding an svg circle (d3 examples)?  The svg cspace gets
inserted into the cspace of the doc.  So there is an implicit
transform mapping coords from the cs:SVG to cs:DOM. Or rather than
cs:DOM, to whatever cspace is associated with the DOM parent of the
svg node.  Call it the "host" cspace?  In any case, this is all
implicit.

A DOM node always has an associated piece of geometry.  Compare TikZ
nodes, which are named bits of geometry.

Note that you cannot transform a cspace you are attaching to the DOM;
attaching always means mapping origin to origin. (?)  You can
transform subspaces within the cs:SVG, but you cannot use any
transform other than the identity transform for mapping cs:SVG to
cs:Host.

Weeell, not really; you can use CSS positioning and offsetting.  So
you can specify a transform, but not directly as a transform.  That's
one of the design shortcomings of CSS.

Plus, you rarely know where a host node cspace is itself going to end
up after composition.

In any case, the goal pursued here is investigation of DOM as a kind
of coordinate space.  Or more generally (covering XML as well as
HTML), of tree structured data and their relation of graphic
coordinate spaces.


================

Kinds of "content coordinate spaces".  Sequence, Relation, Tree, Graph
(net).  

Plaintext is a sequential structure, so display of plaintext editor
maps sequence to one cspace.

Postscript has some hierarchy - pages, for example.  But basically the
graphical figs on a postscript page do not map to a tree structure.
You can reference variables, data structures, etc. within PS, but
that's all internal.  There is no content data structure that stands
separate from the language, as is the case with XML, where there is a
data structure and API used by client languages.

PDF?  Another page description language; I don't recall much of a
content model standing separate from the graphic language, but it's
been quite a while since I looked.

In all these cases, when you add a figure to a space, you say where it
is to be placed.  You might express that in terms of offsets or
something, but you always refer to some known point of reference.  You
don't just say "offset (x,y) from the upleft corner of parent
figure, wherever that happens to end up" as is the case with HTML+CSS.

Hmm.  Better review my PS/PDF.  As in most graphics languages, when
you position something at (x,y) in PS/PDF, the implicit assumption is
that the cspace involved may be transformed later.  So all positioning
is relative until demonstrated otherwise.

So what are we looking for here?  Uniformity of expression?  We want
to use the same positioning language for both web and print targets.
In particular, we want to completely hide the DOM, since a DOM API
would be meaningless for e.g. PDF.  The D3 strategy of "selecting" DOM
nodes and then binding data makes no sense if there is no DOM.

A graphics language just specifies graphicky stuff, not content stuff.
D3 and similar muddies the distinction by mingling content access
vocab and graphics vocab.

One approach: treat DOM nodes (and selectors) as names of coordinates
in cspace.  Compare named nodes in TikZ/PGF.  Then the semantics would
be purely geometric.  At least for accessing; what about
adding/appending?  Appending a DOM node corresponds to specifying
another point in cspace.  Think path v. ink.  Appending an empty div
node is just like adding a point object to the path collection.  The
difference is that the cs coords of the empty div are unresolved; it's
like saying "add a point object, but I'll tell you the coordinates
later".  In other words, like an unevaluated lambda(?), or a "virtual"
point.  Another diff: DOM objects inherently ordered; add two empty
divs and they will retain that order.  Add two virtual points and they
are unordered.  Or: the only order in a cspace is that defined by the
geometry of the space.  The temporal order in which stuff gets added
is discarded.

Or: the order of an XML tree is just abstract order, A precedes B,
without any concrete definition of what "precedes" means (i.e. it does
not mean greater than, less than, etc.)
